# Path_Finding_Visualizer
Introduction :
The Path Finding Visualizer is a simple yet effective tool designed to visualize two popular pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). It offers an interactive interface that allows users to understand the workings of these algorithms by observing their execution in real-time.

Pathfinding algorithms are essential in solving various routing problems, such as finding the shortest path between two points or navigating through a maze. The Path Finding Visualizer provides a visual representation of these algorithms in action, making it easier for users to grasp their concepts and principles.

Features :
Grid Visualization: The visualizer presents a grid-based representation of the search space, where each cell represents a node. Users can observe how the algorithms traverse this grid to find the optimal path.

Start and Goal Nodes: Users can define a starting point and a goal point within the grid, allowing the algorithms to search for the shortest path between these two nodes.

Obstacles: The visualizer allows users to place obstacles within the grid, representing impassable areas. This feature demonstrates how the algorithms navigate around obstacles to reach the goal.

Algorithm Selection: Users can choose between BFS and DFS algorithms to visualize their execution. This choice enables users to compare and contrast the differences in search strategies employed by these algorithms.

Real-Time Visualization: The visualizer animates the execution of the chosen algorithm, highlighting the current node being explored and the discovered path. Users can observe how the algorithm progresses step by step, providing valuable insights into its behavior.
